@book{stopford_designing_2018,
	title = {Designing Event-Driven Systems},
	abstract = {Many forces affect software today: larger datasets, geographical disparities, complex company structures, and the growing need to be fast and nimble in the face of change. Proven approaches such as service-oriented and event-driven architectures are joined by newer techniques such as microservices, reactive architectures, {DevOps}, and stream processing. Many of these patterns are successful by themselves, but as this practical ebook demonstrates, they provide a more holistic and compelling approach when applied together. Author Ben Stopford explains how service-based architectures and stream processing tools such as Apache Kafka can help you build business-critical systems. You'll learn how to apply patterns including Event Sourcing and {CQRS}, and how to build multi-team systems with microservices and {SOA} using patterns such as "inside out databases" and "event streams as a source of truth." These approaches provide a unique foundation for how these large, autonomous service ecosystems can communicate and share data. Learn why streaming beats request-response based architectures in complex, contemporary use cases Understand why replayable logs such as Kafka provide a backbone for both service communication and shared datasets Explore how event collaboration and event sourcing patterns increase safety and recoverability with functional, event-driven approaches Build service ecosystems that blend event-driven and request-driven interfaces using a replayable log and Kafka's Streams {API} Scale beyond individual teams into larger, department- and company-sized architectures, using event streams as a source of truth.},
