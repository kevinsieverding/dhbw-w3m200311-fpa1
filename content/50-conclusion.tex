\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

This work set out to answer the question of what benefits schemas and schema management provide to a distributed system using \gls{mom}.
To that end, it analyzes the introduction of Avro schemas to an example architecture and judges its benefits based on the qualities of reactive systems.

As a result, section \ref{sec:schema-benefits} describes the benefits of schemas for reactive systems.
Section \ref{sec:schema-management} continues by describing how schema management addresses the caveat of schema evolution identified in \ref{sec:introducing-schemas}.
In summary, schemas can make a system more responsive, resilient, and flexible.
However, a schema management solution is required to make proper use of schema evolution.
Finally, section \ref{sec:schema-management-definition} deduces a definition of schema management and schema management solutions from the previous analysis.

Still, many open points remain.
For example, it would be intriguing to see whether the findings of this work also transfer to a similar setup that uses different technologies like a combination of Google's ProtoBuf and RabbitMQ.
Furthermore, the introduction alluded to an issue in the literature with very little diversity in the schema management solutions used.
This work does not address that issue, but it may serve as a solid foundation for future work that tackles it.
