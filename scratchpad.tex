% Introduction

When, in \citeyear{kreps_kafka_2011}, the LinkedIn employees \citeauthor{kreps_kafka_2011} introduced their new \enquote{Event Streaming Platform} \emph{Kafka}, they also mentioned a \enquote{lightweight schema registry service}.
Eleven years later, Kafka has joined the Apache Software Foundation as an open-source project and \enquote{[m]ore than 80\% of all Fortune 100 companies trust, and use [it].} \parencite{noauthor_apache_nodate}.

Coinciding with Kafka's popularity in the private sector, a variety of academic works make use of it as a part of Information System\todo{acronym} designs in the IoT\todo{acronym} and Big Data areas.\todo{citation}
Some of these also make mention employing a schema registry, referring to either just a \enquote{schema registry} or name the \enquote{Confluent Schema Registry} explicitly.

\subsection{Motivation}\label{sub-sec:motivation}

When my team and I working at SAP were searching for a Message-oriented Middleware\todo{acronym} to facilitate asynchronous communication between microservices that make up our application, we quickly discovered Apache Kafka and were intrigued by its features.

We soon decided to use it as the central Message Broker of our application and chose Apache Avro to define message schemas and serialize message instances.
So far, our setup mimicked the one described in \cite{kreps_kafka_2011} to a large degree.
As they did, we then discovered that if we wanted to exploit Apache Avro's capabilities for schema evolution in our distributed system, we needed a dedicated software component to manage and distribute our message schemas.
We discovered our requirement for schema management.
